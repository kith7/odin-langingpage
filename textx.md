Neck rotation
Owls can turn their nekcs 135 degrees both right and left which gives the total of 270 deg not as some people say that they can rotate their necks 360 degrees.

Parliament
As bizarre as it may sound, a group of owls is called a parliament, even though they are rarely seen in groups. Is it because the bird has always been associated with wisdom?

Food
Owls mostly eat other animals ranging from insects, fish to other birds, sometimes owls eat other owls.

Camouflage
Sometimes it may be hard to find them because their feathers let them blend in with their surroundings.

Hooting
Owls hoot at night so as to protect their territories from other owls or to attract a mate.

"An owl is the wisest of all birds because the more it sees the the less it talks."

- Christie Watson.
